    API for EGC provides to accept broadcasts
    
    **Design considerations**
    
    *Two-phase send*
        
    Sending a new MSI is two-phase (create then send). This is
    because the msiId value is a critical piece of information
    for the client (to be able to check status and/or cancel)
    and the API design must ensure that the client is safely 
    in possession of msiID before a send happens. If the 
    method was one phase then there would be no guarantee that
    the msiID was received (a failure could happen in any link
    in the return snetworking chain like a router, firewall, proxy 
    server or indeed a problem at the client application end
    that prevented persistence of the msiID for later use).
    Moreover, if the method was one phase and a failure in the
    network chain occurred then not only would an orphan MSI 
    be sent by the provider but the client would not have
    knowledge that the MSI had been successfully queued for
    sending and would naturally retry the send (multiple times
    even) and we end up with the same MSI being sent 2+ times.
    
    To further clarify the problem being solved by a two phase
    send here is a discussion of the delivery guarantees of HTTP 
    responses, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49444723/how-to-make-sure-the-http-response-was-delivered
    
    Note that a one phase call where the client generated a new 
    unique id (using a UUID for instance) is a possible solution 
    but is less desirable because it introduces a problematic 
    edge case where the client accidentally uses the same id more
    than once. To detect this synchronously (to throw an immediate
    error) has scalability/availability consequences for the 
    server side because a transactional resource must be used
    (like a relational database) that can ensure single use of any 
    msiId. If the server creates the msiId and communicates it to
    the client then the server side can potentially be scaled with
    ease if the msiID is a UUID for instance (which is effectively 
    unique without coordination with other nodes).
    
    Note also that to support two-phase send an additional status
    value has been added, `CREATED`.
    
    **Pagination**
    
    The List MSIs action uses a paginated response as the number of 
    MSIs in a response can get large. Client-driven pagination is 
    where the client specifies an offset (skip) field and that number
    of rows is skipped by the server to return the next page. This
    can be inefficient for the server-side (see 
    https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset) and it is preferred to 
    use server-driven pagination which is where each page returned 
    also includes a continuation token to be included in the next page 
    call. The nice thing about this approach is that the server side
    can simply return an offset in the continuation token if desired but 
    we enable more efficient techniques if wanted later.

        Submits message content and returns a unique id (across all 
        users) that is to be used in the send method. It is ok for
        a message to never be sent but the provider should have the 
        ability to clean up (delete) unsent messages after some 
        reasonable period (TODO ask providers what is reasonable
        minimum period so it can be documented here).
