# Enhanced Group Call (EGC) API

This repository is a collaboration point to support the development of a common and fully-defined REST API to be implemented by EGC satellite service providers (currently Inmarsat and Iridium) and used by Maritime Safety Information (MSI) providers throughout the world. 

The defacto standard for the definition of REST APIs is [OpenAPI v3](https://swagger.io/specification/) which is a YAML or JSON document. The YAML and JSON representations are equivalent, this site uses YAML format for its readability advantages.

The OpenAPI v3 definition for the EGC API is [openapi.yml](openapi.yml). 

Documentation generated from openapi.yml is [here](https://amsa-code.github.io/egc-api/) (and is updated using this [script](scripts/update-gh-pages.sh)). 

Note that a number of design considerations are discussed in the opening description block of [openapi.yml](openapi.yml).

A useful tool for editing and visualizing the API in HTML documentation is at https://editor.swagger.io/.

## MSI Class Diagram

Below is a visualization of the data model of an MSI broadcast (as a [UML Class Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram)).

Notes:
* A SARBroadcast has zero or one SARBroadcastArea. When a SARBroadcastArea is not specified the whole coverage area is assumed.
* An MSI has zero or one Repetition. When a Repetition is not specified then the broadcast happens only once (there may still be the standard 6 minute echo). 
* An EGC satellite service provider should be able to map this model to C-Codes if desired (raise an issue if this is not the case)
